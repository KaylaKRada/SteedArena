# 🧊 Steed Arena Systems Analysis Project  
**Course:** Systems Analysis & Design  
**Team:** Oliver Atkinson, Clayton DeSimone, Kayla Rada  
**Semester:** Fall 2023  
**Instructor:** Bill Halannan – Helena College, University of Montana

## 🚦 Overview
This was a team project where we were assigned to perform a full systems analysis on a real-world client. We choose Steed Arena, the only local ice rink in Helena, Montana. Originally, we thought the biggest issue was the ticketing system, but after talking with the owner, we realized energy efficiency and rising utility costs were a much bigger concern to them. So we pivoted and tailored our entire report to focus on those areas.

## 🚗 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

### 🔹 **Challenge / Context**  
Our team needed to investigate current systems used at Steed Arena and find ways to improve them using tools and techniques we learned in class. We expected to dig into their ticketing platform, but after meeting with the arena's owner, we discovered that outdated compressors and high energy bills were the real pain points. So we shifted gears.

### 🔧 **Action**  
We analyzed the arena’s mechanical systems, interviewed stakeholders, and researched solutions that could help reduce costs and improve efficiency. Some of the areas we covered were:  
- Implementing Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs)  
- Adding humidity control systems  
- Exploring solar panel options and their ROI
  
I personally helped lead the research on alternative energy systems and handled formatting and final edits on the written report.

### ✅ **Result**  
We delivered a full 29-page report that broke down current operations, pain points, and feasible solutions—complete with system requirements, cost estimates, and energy-saving proposals. Our professor was super impressed with our adaptability and the depth of our analysis, especially since we shifted focus based on real feedback from the client.

### 💭 **Reflection**  
This project helped me better understand what it means to design systems that are both user- and business-friendly. I also got firsthand experience with adjusting project scope, collaborating across roles, and presenting data-driven recommendations in a way that’s actually useful to stakeholders. Definitely one of the most practical and rewarding team projects I’ve done so far.
